# Basic Auth with SvelteKit and Drizzle
> Lot of things still need to cover, so don't use this as your only guideline. Please refer to [Official Real World Example](https://github.com/sveltejs/realworld/tree/master). It's shows you good code example

Just testing project to implement authentication using proper `Form action` and `loader`.

It has basic authentication functionality
- Register
- Login
- Logout
- Protected Route


I guess it's a good step to grasp basic understanding of sveltekit, it covers important topic like
- routing
- ssr
- general svelte state management using context
- hooks
- API
- form action and loader
